Use Microsoft Planetary Computer for Python implementations of water quality indices

Satellite data, while publically available, is hard to use. Microsoft's Planetary Computer makes it easy to use satellite data
towards your own means by providing a Python library. Agencies who can benefit from these data sources often lack the technical
expertise needed to analyse satellite data. Here, we will be implementing water quality indices indices and making it publicly
available.
